# Redux

Starting with Redux

### What is Redux ?

- Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- Redux makes it easy to manage the state of your application. Another way of looking at this – it helps you manage the data you display and how you respond to user actions.
- Dan Abramov created Redux to make development more fun with better tooling.
- He’s the guy who’s written some amazing modules like create-react-app, react-hot-loader and react-dnd.
- He wanted a minimal API that improved the application structure and had better tools. At 2kb, Redux makes data management and debugging a whole lot easier.
- Redux was inspired by Flux and Elm.
